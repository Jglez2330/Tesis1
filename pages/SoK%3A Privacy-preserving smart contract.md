	- The paper aims to bridge the existing research gap on PPSC schemes by systematizing previous studies in the field. Its primary focus lies on two categories: PPSC schemes based on cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs, as well as schemes based on trusted execution environments.
	- The authors aim to provide a condensed summary of the different approaches taken in constructing PPSC schemes. Additionally, a comparative analysis of these approaches is offered, highlighting the similarities and differences between them.
	- Furthermore, the paper sheds light on the challenges developers encounter when designing and implementing PPSC schemes. It also delves into potential future directions for improving and advancing these schemes, discussing possible avenues for further research and development.
- Crypto-based PPSC schemes
	- These schemes utilize cryp- tographic tools such as non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZK), secure multi-party computation (MPC), and homomorphic encryption (HE). To handle private data, most of these schemes either directly adopt and extend Zerocashâ€™s DAP scheme [9], where the commitments of private data are stored on the blockchain and can only be used once, or they become variants of DAP scheme to store the ciphertext of private data on the blockchain. Users keep their encryption keys or private data off the chain. The main challenge lies in enabling efficient smart contract execution that involves private data from multiple users. Additionally, these schemes also encounter challenges in terms of NIZK efficiency, NIZK expressiveness, function privacy, and inter-contract exchanging data.
- TEE-based PPSC schemes.
	- By introducing hardware manu- facturers as trusted parties, these schemes utilize trusted exe- cution environments (TEEs), especially Intel SGX. A key feature called remote attestation provide proofs to convince other parties of the trustworthiness and integrity of the executing environ- ment, which eliminates the need for NIZK proofs. TEEs address the efficiency issues faced by crypto-based schemes, particularly in multi-user scenarios. Nevertheless, challenges persist in TEE- based PPSC schemes, especially regarding the proper design of key distribution and short-term key derivation to manage private data.
