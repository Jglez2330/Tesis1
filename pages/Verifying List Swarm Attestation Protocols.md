- This paper tries to introduce a formalisation for list swarm attestation protocols
	- Legitimate Response (𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠) (LR(𝑠))
	- Result Timeliness.
	- Prover Authentication
- It also present more some modification on SIMPLE to make it more robust
- What problem the paper presents
	- They is not formal definition for CRA list swarm attestation protocols. This means that there is not set of characteristics that list CRA protocals meet to ensure a basic secure setup.
- Why the problem is interesting
	- The formalisation of a common set of formal requirements will help to categorize and set a minimum requirement for new swarm protocols
- Interesting concepts:
	- In this paper, we focus on L-QoSA protocols, which let a verifier identify which provers in the swarm are healthy and which provers failed to be successfully attested, e.g., SIMPLE+ [5], LISA-𝛼 [10], SANA [2], and SeED [23].
	- Quality of Swarm Attestation (QoSA), which describes how much information about the swarm a verifier receives.
- Formalisation:
	- Defining a Swarm
