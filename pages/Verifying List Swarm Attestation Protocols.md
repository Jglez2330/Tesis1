- This paper tries to introduce a formalisation for list swarm attestation protocols
	- Legitimate Response (𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠) (LR(𝑠))
	- Result Timeliness.
	- Prover Authentication
- It also present more some modification on SIMPLE to make it more robust
- What problem the paper presents
	- They is not formal definition for CRA list swarm attestation protocols. This means that there is not set of characteristics that list CRA protocals meet to ensure a basic secure setup.
- Why the problem is interesting
	- The formalisation of a common set of formal requirements will help to categorize and set a minimum requirement for new swarm protocols
- Interesting concepts:
	- In this paper, we focus on L-QoSA protocols, which let a verifier identify which provers in the swarm are healthy and which provers failed to be successfully attested, e.g., SIMPLE+ [5], LISA-𝛼 [10], SANA [2], and SeED [23].
	- Quality of Swarm Attestation (QoSA), which describes how much information about the swarm a verifier receives.
- Formalisation:
	- Defining a Swarm
		- In the context of CRA protocols, the paper outlines two primary roles: the prover (denoted as 𝑝𝑟𝑣) and the verifier (denoted as vrf). A distinctive feature of CRA protocols is the involvement of multiple provers in a single execution of the protocol. These provers are collectively referred to as 𝑃. The combination of a single verifier and the set of provers is represented as a swarm, noted as the pair (vrf, 𝑃). The paper specifically concentrates on CRA protocols that employ a single verifier for its analysis.
	- Defining State and Status.
		- Similar to automatons language ∑

		- We let Σ denote the set of all possible software states that a prover can be in. The purpose of an attestation protocol is to determine the Status of the provers. If a prover is in a state that the verifier considers acceptable, it has the healthy status. Otherwise, it is unhealthy.
			- Status = {Healthy, Unhealthy}
	- Defining Digest.
		- Representation of the Status.
		- Could Help to cover prover information
		- At the core of a CRA protocol is the gener- ation of a digest from a prover’s state. The set of all digests for a software state is given by
			- Digest = {h(𝜎) | 𝜎 ∈ Σ}
	- Representing Time.
		- Count to tell the timeliness of a challenge.
		- Count must be monotonic
		- in CRA protocols, a prover can undergo the attestation process multiple times. Therefore, it is essential to document the exact moment of each attestation. The method for capturing this timing can vary: it might involve precise real-time measurements using clocks or could be represented in a more abstract form, such as through round numbers.
	- Formal Result and sets
		- The software configuration 𝜎 ∈ Σ of a prover 𝑝𝑟𝑣 ∈ 𝑃 at a given real time 𝜏 ∈ R+ is a member of the set:
			- Γ =𝑃 × Σ × R+
		- An attestation result is generated  from a configuration at a particular time:
			- 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡 = 𝑃 × Digest × T
		- We assume that a result for a prover, software state, and time (𝑝𝑟𝑣,𝜎,𝜏) ∈ Γ using the following function:
			- 𝜇 : Γ → 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡 where𝜇((𝑝𝑟𝑣,𝜎,𝜏)) = (𝑝𝑟𝑣,h(𝜎),𝑡),and𝜏 ∈𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑(𝑝𝑟𝑣,𝑡)
			  Finally, a result can be judged to indicate a status using 𝜌 : 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡 → Status
